title: Style Guide
---

This guide serves as a reference for anyone authoring, editing, or reviewing the pro-product documentation.

## Grammar

### Active/passive voice
	
- Avoid passive voice unless it is unavoidable.
- Use the active form of nouns (displays -not- displayed).    

Per the Microsoft Manual of Style:

- Active voice emphasizes the person or thing performing the action.
- It’s more direct than passive voice, which can be confusing or sound formal.

Please review the [Posit Voice](/getting-started/getting-started.html#posit-voice) section for additional information.

### Parentheses 

APA Style 6th Edition:

- Punctuation goes inside of parentheses when the entire sentence is enclosed in the parentheses.

- Punctuation goes outside of parentheses when only a portion of a sentence is enclosed in parentheses.

### Contractions

*Avoid*

### Quotation marks

Punctuation - (inside vs. outside):

- Inside quotation marks. Piece of code = outside. 
- Examples:     

    - grammar: “My friend Mary,” she said, “is crazy!”  
    - code: To start the program, run `runApp`.

### Oxford (serial) comma

- Include the final comma in a list of three or more items. The cat liked to jump, eat, and meow.

### Dashes

- En dash vs. Em dash:
    - En dash:  A dash the width of an “n”. Use for ranges or spans of numbers.
    - Em dash: A dash the width of an “m”. Can take the place of colons.

### i.e. vs. e.g.

- i.e.: In other words
- e.g.:  For example

### etc.

- When used in the middle of a sentence, and is not enclosed in parentheses, include a period and a comma after the abbreviation.
- If used at the end of a sentence, simply use a period.
- If enclosed in a parentheses and is at the end of the sentence, use a period. No comma is needed.

## Content

### Titles and headings

- Titles and H1s: Title Case
- All other headings: Sentence case

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

#### Steps as headings

Especially for docs.posit.co - proper:

- If you are going to use a heading to represent a step/procedure, then the name of the heading should include the word “Step”. 
- For example, an H2 representing a step/procedure would be written as, “Step 1: Install RStudio Connect”. 

This is extremely important from an Accessibility perspective, especially for those who may be using a screen reader to listen to our documentation.

### Callouts

Callouts, sometimes referred to as "admonitions", are used to draw attention to content and/or information that doesn't fit into the normal flow of text.

:::{.callout-note}
Quarto and MkDocs Material offer different types of callouts. 

Items marked with an <bold>*</bold> are only available w/ MkDocs Material.


 - [Quarto's callout types](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html#callout-types)
 - [MkDocs Matieral callout types](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/)

:::

| Callout type | Definition
|---|-------------------
example <bold>*</bold> | Used for steps/procedures.
important | If this information is ignored, it is unlikely that the user will be able to complete the task or make configuration changes in the future.
info <bold>*</bold> | Additional information, such as, “Our recommended installation instructions for R allow you to make multiple versions of R available.”
note | Information that helps the user, provides additional information, clarity, and may increase efficiency.
question <bold>*</bold> | Typically reserved for when a user may require help information, solutions, support, etc. For example, “If you require help information, run `$ bash ./rsc-installer.sh help<LICENSE-KEY>`.”
quote <bold>*</bold> | When you directly quote the works of others in your documentation.
success <bold>*</bold> | Indicates that the install and/or configuration is complete.
tip | Information that makes the user’s experience easier, may contain additional functionality that is not required for installation or configuration or has information that an advanced user may be interested in.
warning / caution | Warning: Explains dangers that may result in personal injury or death. <br>Caution: Explains hazards that could damage a product, including data loss.

### Reusing content

We have several options for conveinently reusing content across our documentation. This allows us to easily duplicate information, without needing to update it in several places. Common use cases for this would be version numbers, common callouts/warnings, etc.

#### Snippets / macros

*MkDocs Material, only*

You can include the contents of another file, into your current file, by using a snippet. If the included file is updated, the updates automatically update anywhere that the snippet has been used.

MkDocs Material has a [complete description and the notation of snippets](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/).

Notation:

`--8<-- "filename.ext"`

#### Includes

*Quarto, only*

To include a file, add the {{< include >}} shortcode at the location in your document where you want it included:


A very important thing to understand about includes is that they are equivalent to copying and pasting the text from the included file into the main file. This means that relative references (links, images, etc.) inside the included file resolve based on the directory of the main file not the included file.

Notation:

`{{< include _content.qmd >}}`

Quarto has a [complete description and the notation of includes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html).

#### Cross references

*Quarto, only*

Cross-references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to various entities like figures and tables. 

See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) for additional information.

### Formatting text instructions

**Bold**

From the **View** menu, click **Publish**.

- When you must refer to a button, check box, or other options, use **bold** formatting for the name.
- Sentence style unless you need to match the UI.


"Quotes"

In the **Password** field, type "1234".

- User-supplied values.

`Inline-code` & configuration properties

In the Connect configuration file, navigate to the `Server.Address` property.

- Inline-code/configuration properties should be within backticks.

### Procedures/steps

Action → Result should always be part of the action step

Multi-step procedures, use:

- [Numbered list](#numbered-lists)

Single-step procedures, use:

- [Unordered (bulleted) list](#bulleted-lists)

Examples: 

- Click **OK**. A dialog displays.
- The configuration section allows you to configure your product. Deleting this file may result in a loss of data.

#### Simple sequences

You can use a right angle bracket to abbreviate simple sequences (steps).

- There should be a space before and after the bracket
- Do not bold the bracket

Examples:

- Select **File** > **New Document** > **Markdown**.
- Select **Projects** > **New** and click **Markdown**.

### Lists

#### Bulleted lists:

- Can be used for lists or procedures.
- Ending punctuation: Be consistent. For each item in a list, stick to using ending punctuation or don’t use it at all.
- If there are two items/steps or fewer, then use bullet points or nothing at all. 
- When giving a user multiple options, for example:

    - To install RStudio, do one of the following:
    
        - Manual installation
        - Guided installation

#### Numbered lists

- Can be used for lists or procedures.
- Use ending punctuation.
- Use when a procedure needs to be specifically referenced.
- Use to describe things that need to be done in a sequential order

Please see [Procedures/steps](#proceduressteps) for more information.

### Code

We use code blocks throughout the documentation that perform syntax highlighting via the CodeHilte extension and the MkDocs-Material theme.

CodeHilte uses Pygments for syntax highlighting of various languages. Pygments supports a number of different languages via different lexers.

For the list of languages and when to use them, see the Code section in the Pro Product Doc - Cheatsheet


### Calls to code

Calls to R, Python code, shell commands, & other languages.

Denote calls with the accent grave (example: `runApp`). Use the accent marks/backticks wherever appropriate. Ensure that  the text within already written accent marks exactly matches the code,  since it may change  how code is run and result in errors.

If the documentation framework doesn’t support accent graves, use code blocks, inline code, or whatever the framework supports.


### Numbers

As a general rule, spell out single-digit numbers, and use numerals to represent double-digit numbers, e.g., one and. 10.


### Images

Images should NEVER be used to replace written steps/be essential to completing a task (see [Accessibility](doc-rules.qmd#accessibility)).

- Ensure that images are legible, do your best to exclude blank space, and exclude things that are not necessary for the purpose of the image. 
- When referencing something from the UI, use an image “step tag” or "callout box/shape".
- Additionally, the image should always follow the reference to the image and the result of the action should come after the image.

#### Image callout box/shape and step tags

:::{.callout-note}
The formatting guidance below provides guidance that works for most images. In certain cases, you may need to change the size, color, and/or weight of the shapes and step tags. Be as consistent as possible. If your editing software is unable to follow these guidelines, please contact Ashley Henry or Annika Kriov for assistance.
:::

##### Shapes

**Rectangle/box:**

Ensure that they are close to the border of the buttons, menu items, etc.

![](img/rectangle.png){width="200px" fig-align="center"}

|         |
|---------|----------|
 Outline color | #CD2026
 Fill | None/transparent
 Border weight | 5pt 
 Shadow | none


**Arrows:**

Typically used as a replacement for our "rectangle shape". In certain cases, our rectangle shape blends into the UI. If that is the case, use an arrow instead.


Do your best to make the arrows the same size,  style, and color. Arrows are used to point to one specific item on the UI.

|         |
|---------|----------|
 Line end | Filled line end
 Color | #CD3034 
 Width | 5pt 
 Shadow | none
 Style | ![](img/arrow-style.png){width="200px"}

#### Image borders

Since our documentation UI and our product UIs are so similar, in some cases, we need to add image borders to have add distinction so it is clear where the image "starts and ends".

It would be best to add a CSS/SCSS element that automatically adds a border to ALL images automatically.


#### Alt text

Images should include alternate text for screen-reader users. Informative text should be no more than 150 characters, roughly. Avoid including the words “image” or “graphic” because the screen-reader software automatically indicates that it is an image. However, it is acceptable to identify a screenshot as such. If the image is essential to accomplishing the task at hand, then you must include the necessary information in combination with the image’s alternate text and the technical documentation.

### Acronyms

- Spell out the first occurrence of an acronym per topic/page/file, followed by the acronym in parentheses. 
- You do not need to define common acronyms, such as IP.

Example:

- The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States. The CIA has no law enforcement function.

### Gerunds & Tech jargon

Avoid.

### Proper nouns and UI elements

- Are always capitalized. 
- However, always follow the same capitalization format that is displayed in the UI when referring to product screens directly.
    - For example, if a menu name isn't capitalized in the UI, write it exactly as it appears. If it is in all caps, use all caps when referencing it in the docs.


### Terminology references

Use| Do NOT use | How to use
------- | ------- | -------
check box | checkbox | N/A
clear | uncheck | Check boxes, radio buttons
click | N/A | Buttons, menus, cursors, etc.
cursor / mouse cursor | mouse | Hover your cursor over the map. In the desired area, click-and-drag your cursor to draw a shape.
dialog box | dialog or dialogues | It is ok to use "dialog" in other contexts, especially for a technical audience. A dialog box contains controls, such as command buttons and list boxes through which users can carry out a particular command or task. For example, a Save As dialog box the user must indicate in which folder and under what name the doc should be saved.
drop-down | dropdown or drop down | Can be used as a drop-down list, drop-down menu, drop-down arrow, etc.
enter | Do not use it as a synonym for "type". | Do not use it as a synonym for type except to indicate that a user can interact with the UI by multiple methods, such as either typing text or clicking a selection from a list. Additionally, if you are referring to the keyboard key. For example: Type your password, and then press Enter.
field | box | Search field, Name field, etc.
pop-up | popup | Do not use it as a noun. Do not use it as a verb to mean open or appear. It is ok to use "pop-up window".
select | check | Check boxes, radio buttons, items in a list box, drop-downs, etc.
toolbar | tool bar | Contains buttons and can have submenus.
type | "insert or type in" | Use when directing the user to enter information. For example, Type your password. Use when directing the user to enter specific information. In the field, type "12345".
open source | open-source | Should be lowercase (e.g., the open source community) unless speaking of a specific thing that has the words “open source” in its title (e.g., the Open Source Initiative)
email | e-mail | N/A
user-interface | user interface | N/A
