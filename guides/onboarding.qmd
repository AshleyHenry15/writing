title: Onboarding for Technical Writers
---

Welcome to Posit! Although we expect every developer to also wear a technical-writing hat, we understand that "formal" technical writers may need to take a slightly different onboarding path.

Here at Posit, at the minimum we expect our writers to:

- Uphold and implement our Style Guide
- Act as a mentor to developers that are writing documentation
- Learn technologies quickly
- Have strong communication skills
- Treat docs-as-code
- Understand git and how to we use GitHub


This onboarding section covers some of the basics that will help get you up and running here at Posit!
