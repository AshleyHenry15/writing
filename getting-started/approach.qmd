title: Approaching docs

## Writing checklist

Determine:

- The reason for the documentation change/request
- What type of documentation is required
- Where the new documentation should "live"
    - Existing: Determine where the source code of the current documentation lives
- Search ALL documentation to verify:
   - If this is already documented
   - How many places may require an update
   - If other documented features may also require an update based on these changes
- Coordinate with the product's documentation owner. See [POC](../references/pocs.qmd)



## SDLC - How should docs "fit"

We need to continue to integrate documentation into each teamâ€™s SDLC:

- Docs is an equal stakeholder that is involved in backlog grooming, planning, development, QA, and release.
- Documentation consideration from the start ensures that: 
  - The writer can provide input in the early stages of development which may help make the feature more intuitive for the user.
  - The writer can help scope out the documentation work required.
  - The engineer developing a feature knows what is expected and required for documentation updates and has ample time to write/test documentation.
  - The team has time to scrub existing documentation to make the required changes.
  - QA has time to test the feature AND the documentation.
  - We are less likely to have documentation gaps.

If we can lay a solid foundation for SDLC documentation integration, we will be setting up a new writer for success and a much easier/more enjoyable onboarding process.
