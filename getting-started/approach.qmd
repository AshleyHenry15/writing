title: Approaching docs
---

## Writing checklist

Determine:

- The reason for the documentation change/request
- What type of documentation is required
- Where the new documentation should "live"
    - Existing: Determine where the source code of the current documentation lives
- Search ALL documentation to verify:
   - If this is already documented
   - How many places may require an update
   - If other documented features may also require an update based on these changes
- Coordinate with the product's documentation owner. See [POC](../references/pocs.qmd)
