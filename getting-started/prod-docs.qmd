title: Pro Product Docs Overview

::: {.callout-warning}
This page is a partial duplicate of the [GitHub docs.rstudio.com/README](https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com/blob/main/README.md).

## docs.rstudio.com  

Acts as a "home base" for new professional product users and professional product documentation focused on initial installations, configurations, and integrations.

## Documentation Build

The documentation is stored and hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket named docs.rstudio.com, which is associated with a CloudFront CDN distribution.

docs.rstudio.com is the index at the root of the directories that make up the `docs.rstudio.com` Amazon S3 bucket. 
Since `docs.rstudio.com/index.html` is at the root of these directories, this is the page that displays when you navigate to the docs.rstudio.com URL.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Feel free to take a look at the structure of the docs [S3 bucket](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.console.aws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2Fbuckets%2Fdocs.rstudio.com%3Fregion%3Dus-east-1%26state%3DhashArgs%2523%26tab%3Dobjects%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fs3&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=Pr4VG9hqRx3P-Pwt6VIbfmswzVCkK43eMZ1SLfJRCQg&code_challenge_method=SHA-256).
:::
The `docs.rstudio.com` S3 bucket also hosts the directories for the rest of our professional product documentation:

- Workbench guides
- Connect guides
- Package Manager guides *and* 
- Other content that you access with the base URL of docs.rstudio.com.

### Example

The docs.rstudio.com/rsc/installation page's source code lives within the main docs.rstudio.com index directory structure. The source code for this page lives at: https://github.com/rstudio/docs.rstudio.com.

However, docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin does NOT live within the main docs.rstudio.com directory structure. The source code is available at: https://github.com/rstudio/connect.

Essentially, we "drop" the professional product documentation files (HTML/JS/CSS) into subdirectories, like /connect.  
:::

###  How it builds 

Jenkins or a GitHub (GH) action builds the documentation at the source and then drops the finished HTML/JS/CSS into a specific directory of the S3 bucket, for example, /connect.

Now, the finished documentation is available via the docs.rstudio.com/connect URL even though the source code of the documentation does not live in the `docs.rstudio.com` GH repository.
