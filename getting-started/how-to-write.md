## Writing checklist

- Determine the reason for the documentation change/request
- Determine what type of documentation is required
- Determine where the documentation should "live"
- Search ALL documentation to verify:
   - If this is already documented
   - How many places may require an update
   - If other documented features may also require an update based on these changes
