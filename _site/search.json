    "text": "Consistency & shared vocabulary Utilize this guide to help our documentation become consistent and to assist our teams to write with a unified voice.\n\n\nIf possible, avoid duplicating documentation. If you need to reuse information:\n\nUse language that may not need to be updated frequently and add a link to the full documentation\nUse cross-references & links\nUse snippets\n\n\n\n\nBe direct and avoid fluff. Keep our documentation transparent, easy to read, efficient, and search-friendly. Keep the topics and sentences simple, short, and concise. Do not write over our audience’s head or write drastically under it.\nTest its readability here: Readability Test Tool\n\n\n\nWe should aspire to provide documentation that is helpful and easy for everyone to use. When planning, writing, and reviewing documentation, take the time to consider that someone may be using a screen reader to listen to our documentation. For example, ensure that you are writing documentation that is clear and isn’t relying on images to explain an action.\nPlease review our Product Accessibility in a Nutshell documentation.\n\n\n\nClaims should capture what our products and company can, and cannot do. We do not want to make false promises to our customers and there is no need to state that we may support something in the future. We are supporters of the open-source community and have an interdependent relationship with the open source community.\n\n\n\n\nFollow a general template to help standardize our documentation.\nSee topic structure/template.\n\n\n\n\nInsert new content in the most logical or intuitive section of the guide.\nDo not just “stick it at the bottom”.\n\n\n\n\nInconsistent names for the same object may confuse our users. Use consistent names whenever you:\n\nIntroduce a new feature.\nRefer to an existing feature.\nRefer to a specific UI item.\nUpdate existing documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBe sure to search ALL of our documentation to ensure that your product/menu/UI naming is consistent. The Product names and open source product names reference is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nRefer to menus, buttons, elements, etc., exactly how they are displayed in the UI. For example, if there is a SUBMIT button, then it would be in ALL CAPS (and bolded) in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\nClick to view full-sized/zoomed in UI Elements Image\n\n\n\n\nWhen you refer to a specific package in R, use the actual capitalization of the package name (which is usually lowercase, but not always). Follow this rule even if the package name appears at the beginning of a sentence. Why? Because the package name is actual code that the user may type into R; incorrect capitalization could cause an error. Example: ggvis or ggplot2.\nWhen you describe a general product/framework that RStudio has developed, like Shiny or R Markdown, use the RStudio capitalization of the product name. It does get tricky, but here is a heuristic: if you are praising a product to a general audience, go with R Markdown; if you are instructing programmers on how to do something, go with rmarkdown."

This means that relative references (links, images, etc.) inside the included file resolve based on the directory of the main file not the included file.\nNotation:\n{{< include _content.qmd >}}\nQuarto has a complete description and the notation of includes.\n\n\nCross references\nQuarto, only\nCross-references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to various entities like figures and tables.\nSee the Quarto documentation for additional information.\n\n\n\nFormatting text instructions\nBold\nFrom the View menu, click Publish.\n\nWhen you must refer to a button, check box, or other options, use bold formatting for the name.\nSentence style unless you need to match the UI.\n\n“Quotes”\nIn the Password field, type “1234”.\n\nUser-supplied values.\n\nInline-code & configuration properties\nIn the Connect configuration file, navigate to the Server.Address property.\n\nInline-code/configuration properties should be within backticks.\n\n\n\nProcedures/steps\nAction → Result should always be part of the action step\nMulti-step procedures, use:\n\nNumbered list\n\nSingle-step procedures, use:\n\nUnordered (bulleted) list\n\nExamples:\n\nClick OK. A dialog displays.\nThe configuration section allows you to configure your product. Deleting this file may result in a loss of data.\n\n\nSimple sequences\nYou can use a right angle bracket to abbreviate simple sequences (steps).\n\nThere should be a space before and after the bracket\nDo not bold the bracket\n\nExamples:\n\nSelect File > New Document > Markdown.\nSelect Projects > New and click Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nLists\n\nBulleted lists:\n\nCan be used for lists or procedures.\nEnding punctuation: Be consistent. For each item in a list, stick to using ending punctuation or don’t use it at all.\nIf there are two items/steps or fewer, then use bullet points or nothing at all.\nWhen giving a user multiple options, for example:\n\nTo install RStudio, do one of the following:\n\nManual installation\nGuided installation\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbered lists\n\nCan be used for lists or procedures.\nUse ending punctuation.\nUse when a procedure needs to be specifically referenced.\nUse to describe things that need to be done in a sequential order\n\nPlease see Procedures/steps for more information.\n\n\n\nCode\nWe use code blocks throughout the documentation that perform syntax highlighting via the CodeHilte extension and the MkDocs-Material theme.\nCodeHilte uses Pygments for syntax highlighting of various languages. Pygments supports a number of different languages via different lexers.\nFor the list of languages and when to use them, see the Code section in the Pro Product Doc - Cheatsheet\n\nInline-code\nInline-code is typically used when part or all of a command is used within a step/sentence. For example:\nIf you require help information, in a terminal run $ bash ./rsc-installer.sh help<LICENSE-KEY>\nUse a backtick before and after the code to format:\n`$ bash ./rsc-installer.sh help<LICENSE-KEY>`\n\n\nCalls to code\nCalls to R, Python code, shell commands, & other languages.\nDenote calls with the accent grave (example: runApp). Use the accent marks/backticks wherever appropriate. Ensure that the text within already written accent marks exactly matches the code, since it may change how code is run and result in errors.\nIf the documentation framework doesn’t support accent graves, use code blocks, inline code, or whatever the framework supports.\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\nMkDocs Material\n\nThis section needs updating based on newly introduced styles from MkDocs Material theme.\nWe use code blocks throughout the documentation that perform syntax highlighting via the CodeHilte extension and the MkDocs-Material theme.\nCodeHilte uses Pygments for syntax highlighting of various languages. Pygments supports a number of different languages via different lexers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage type\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nconsole or terminal\nFor commands that are to be run in a terminal\n\n\ntext\nFor text that needs to be in a code block but with no syntax highlighting (e.g., log files)\n\n\ncfg or ini\nFor contents of an ini-style config file with key=value pairs, such as an RSP/RSC/RSPM configuration file. Both of these are aliases/short names that call the same “IniLexer”.\n\n\nr\nFor R code chunks\n\n\npython\nFor Python code chunks\n\n\nbash\nFor showing the contents of a bash script (although, this type of content is rare in our docs. However, it is being used almost 100% currently, and will be updated in the future).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode blocks with titles\nIn MkDocs Material, the following is an example of a code block titled “Terminal”:\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax:\n    ``` bash title=\"Terminal\"\n    $ sudo systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\nIn Quarto, you can add a “Code Filename”: https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#highlighting\n\n\nTabbed code blocks\nTabbed code blocks can be used as an OS selector, version selector, etc.\nCommonly, we used tabbed code blocks for installation and upgrade commands that may be slightly different based on the user’s OS.\nIn MkDocs Material, the following is an example of a tabbed code block:\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax:\n    === \"Ubuntu 20.04\"\n        ```\n        $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core\n        $ curl -O https://cdn.rstudio.com/connect/{{ vars.connect.rsc.short_version }}/rstudio-connect_{{ vars.connect.rsc.full_version }}~ubuntu20_amd64.deb\n        $ sudo gdebi rstudio-connect_{{ vars.connect.rsc.full_version }}~ubuntu20_amd64.deb\n        ```\n\n    === \"Ubuntu 18.04\"\n        ```\n        $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core\n        $ curl -O https://cdn.rstudio.com/connect/{{ vars.connect.rsc.short_version }}/rstudio-connect_{{ vars.connect.rsc.full_version }}~ubuntu18_amd64.deb\n        $ sudo gdebi rstudio-connect_{{ vars.connect.rsc.full_version }}~ubuntu18_amd64.deb\n        ```\n\n\n\nNumbers\nAs a general rule, spell out single-digit numbers, and use numerals to represent double-digit numbers, e.g., one and. 10.\n\n\nImages\nImages should NEVER be used to replace written steps/be essential to completing a task (see Accessibility).\n\nEnsure that images are legible, do your best to exclude blank space, and exclude things that are not necessary for the purpose of the image.\nWhen referencing something from the UI, use an image “step tag” or “callout box/shape”.\nAdditionally, the image should always follow the reference to the image and the result of the action should come after the image.\n\n\nImage callout box/shape and step tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe formatting guidance below provides guidance that works for most images. In certain cases, you may need to change the size, color, and/or weight of the shapes and step tags. Be as consistent as possible. If your editing software is unable to follow these guidelines, please contact Ashley Henry or Annika Kriov for assistance.\n\n\n\nShapes\nRectangle/box:\nEnsure that they are close to the border of the buttons, menu items, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline color\n#CD2026\n\n\nFill\nNone/transparent\n\n\nBorder weight\n5pt\n\n\nShadow\nnone\n\n\n\nArrows:\nTypically used as a replacement for our “rectangle shape”. In certain cases, our rectangle shape blends into the UI. If that is the case, use an arrow instead.\nDo your best to make the arrows the same size,  style, and color. Arrows are used to point to one specific item on the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine end\nFilled line end\n\n\nColor\n#CD3034\n\n\nWidth\n5pt\n\n\nShadow\nnone\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\n\n** Step tags / sequential image arrows\nStep tags:\nYou can use these to show procedures in sequential order or to call out numerous items on a page.\nGoogle slides example\n\n\n\n\n\nSnagit example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShape > Arrows > Pentagon\n(if using Google Slides)\n\n\nStep > Shape > Basic > Cone\n(If using Snagit)\n\n\nFill Color\n#CD3034 or Red (Google Slides)\n\n\nBorder\nNone\n\n\nFont\nArial\n\n\nFont Size\n10 or 12pt\n\n\nFont color\n#ffffff\n\n\n\n\nSequential image arrows:\nThese arrows are sometimes used to show the progression between multiple menu pages, wizards, etc.\n\n\n\n\nShape > Arrows > Right Arrow\n(if using Google Slides)\n\n\nFill color\n#D0E3F4 or Light blue 3 (Google Slides)\n\n\nBorder color\nGray (Google Slides)\n\n\nBorder weight\n1px\n\n\n\nThe preformatted arrows and callouts shown above are available for use in this “template”.\n\n\n\nImage borders\nSince our documentation UI and our product UIs are so similar, in some cases, we need to add image borders to have add distinction so it is clear where the image “starts and ends”.\nIt would be best to add a CSS/SCSS element that automatically adds a border to ALL images automatically.\n\n\nAlt text\nImages should include alternate text for screen-reader users. Informative text should be no more than 150 characters, roughly. Avoid including the words “image” or “graphic” because the screen-reader software automatically indicates that it is an image. However, it is acceptable to identify a screenshot as such. If the image is essential to accomplishing the task at hand, then you must include the necessary information in combination with the image’s alternate text and the technical documentation.\n\n\n\nAcronyms\n\nSpell out the first occurrence of an acronym per topic/page/file, followed by the acronym in parentheses.\nYou do not need to define common acronyms, such as IP.\n\nExample:\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States. The CIA has no law enforcement function.\n\n\n\nGerunds & Tech jargon\nAvoid.\n\n\nProper nouns and UI elements\n\nAre always capitalized.\nHowever, always follow the same capitalization format that is displayed in the UI when referring to product screens directly.\n\nFor example, if a menu name isn’t capitalized in the UI, write it exactly as it appears. If it is in all caps, use all caps when referencing it in the docs.\n\n\n\n\nTerminology references\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse\nDo NOT use\nHow to use\n\n\n\n\ncheck box\ncheckbox\nN/A\n\n\nclear\nuncheck\nCheck boxes, radio buttons\n\n\nclick\nN/A\nButtons, menus, cursors, etc.\n\n\ncursor / mouse cursor\nmouse\nHover your cursor over the map. In the desired area, click-and-drag your cursor to draw a shape.\n\n\ndialog box\ndialog or dialogues\nIt is ok to use “dialog” in other contexts, especially for a technical audience. A dialog box contains controls, such as command buttons and list boxes through which users can carry out a particular command or task. For example, a Save As dialog box the user must indicate in which folder and under what name the doc should be saved.\n\n\ndrop-down\ndropdown or drop down\nCan be used as a drop-down list, drop-down menu, drop-down arrow, etc.\n\n\nenter\nDo not use it as a synonym for “type”.\nDo not use it as a synonym for type except to indicate that a user can interact with the UI by multiple methods, such as either typing text or clicking a selection from a list. Additionally, if you are referring to the keyboard key. For example: Type your password, and then press Enter.\n\n\nfield\nbox\nSearch field, Name field, etc.\n\n\npop-up\npopup\nDo not use it as a noun. Do not use it as a verb to mean open or appear. It is ok to use “pop-up window”.\n\n\nselect\ncheck\nCheck boxes, radio buttons, items in a list box, drop-downs, etc.\n\n\ntoolbar\ntool bar\nContains buttons and can have submenus.\n\n\ntype\n“insert or type in”\nUse when directing the user to enter information. For example, Type your password. Use when directing the user to enter specific information. In the field, type “12345”.\n\n\nopen source\nopen-source\nShould be lowercase (e.g., the open source community) unless speaking of a specific thing that has the words “open source” in its title (e.g., the Open Source Initiative)\n\n\nemail\ne-mail\nN/A\n\n\nuser-interface\nuser interface\nN/A"

For example, if you are documenting a guided installation feature, open by telling our users what the guided installation is, and why/when they should/could use it.\n\n## Prerequisites (h2)\n\nA description of the feature\n\n## Configuration    \n\nExplaination and examples (h2/h3)\n\n## Procedures & expected output (h2/h3)  \n\nExplaination, steps, output, examples, screenshots, etc.\n\n## Related documentation (h2/h3)\n\nThis is a nice thing to include in its own section at the end of the topic."
