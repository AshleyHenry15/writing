Should it live in the product’s admin guide?

Readers have different experiences with coding. There are lots of tools and it can be hard to figure which one is the right tool for the job. Our blog posts acknowledges that we are all doing our best to become better in data without being critical of approaches, tools, or backgrounds.\nSimplicity: If our reader has to reread a sentence multiple times, gets stuck on a word, or gets “lost”, then we are missing the mark. Keep sentences simple and short.\n\n\nThe vast majority of our writing should be in an active voice.\nActive = noun/actor + verb + target\nExample: Python interprets code.\n\nnoun/actor: Python\nverb (active): interprets\ntarget: code\n\nPassive = target + verb + noun/actor\n\ntarget: code\nverb (passive): is interpreted\nnoun/actor: Python\n\nExample: Code is interpreted by Python."

    "text": "Consistency & shared vocabulary Utilize this guide to help our documentation become consistent and to assist our teams to write with a unified voice.\n\n\nIf possible, avoid duplicating documentation. If you need to reuse information:\n\nUse language that may not need to be updated frequently and add a link to the full documentation\nUse cross-references & links\nUse snippets\n\n\n\n\nBe direct and avoid fluff. Keep our documentation transparent, easy to read, efficient, and search-friendly. Keep the topics and sentences simple, short, and concise. Do not write over our audience’s head or write drastically under it.\nTest its readability here: Readability Test Tool\n\n\n\nWe should aspire to provide documentation that is helpful and easy for everyone to use. When planning, writing, and reviewing documentation, take the time to consider that someone may be using a screen reader to listen to our documentation. For example, ensure that you are writing documentation that is clear and isn’t relying on images to explain an action.\nPlease review our Product Accessibility in a Nutshell documentation.\n\n\n\nClaims should capture what our products and company can, and cannot do. We do not want to make false promises to our customers and there is no need to state that we may support something in the future. We are supporters of the open-source community and have an interdependent relationship with the open source community.\n\n\n\n\nFollow a general template to help standardize our documentation.\nSee topic structure/template.\n\n\n\n\nInsert new content in the most logical or intuitive section of the guide.\nDo not just “stick it at the bottom”.\n\n\n\n\nInconsistent names for the same object may confuse our users. Use consistent names whenever you:\n\nIntroduce a new feature.\nRefer to an existing feature.\nRefer to a specific UI item.\nUpdate existing documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBe sure to search ALL of our documentation to ensure that your product/menu/UI naming is consistent. The Product names and open source product names reference is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nRefer to menus, buttons, elements, etc., exactly how they are displayed in the UI. For example, if there is a SUBMIT button, then it would be in ALL CAPS (and bolded) in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\nClick to view full-sized/zoomed in UI Elements Image\n\n\n\n\nWhen you refer to a specific package in R, use the actual capitalization of the package name (which is usually lowercase, but not always). Follow this rule even if the package name appears at the beginning of a sentence. Why? Because the package name is actual code that the user may type into R; incorrect capitalization could cause an error. Example: ggvis or ggplot2.\nWhen you describe a general product/framework that RStudio has developed, like Shiny or R Markdown, use the RStudio capitalization of the product name. It does get tricky, but here is a heuristic: if you are praising a product to a general audience, go with R Markdown; if you are instructing programmers on how to do something, go with rmarkdown."

Piece of code = outside.\nExamples:\n\ngrammar: “My friend Mary,” she said, “is crazy!”\n\ncode: To start the program, run runApp.\n\n\n\n\nOxford (serial) comma\n\nInclude the final comma in a list of three or more items. The cat liked to jump, eat, and meow.\n\n\n\nDashes\n\nEn dash vs. Em dash:\n\nEn dash: A dash the width of an “n”. Use for ranges or spans of numbers.\nEm dash: A dash the width of an “m”.

If it is in all caps, use all caps when referencing it in the docs.\n\n\n\n\nProcedures/steps\nAction → Result should always be part of the action step\nExamples:\n\nClick OK. A dialog displays.\nThe configuration section allows you to configure your product.

For each item in a list, stick to using ending punctuation or don’t use it at all.\nIf there are two items/steps or fewer, then use bullet points or nothing at all.\nWhen giving a user multiple options, for example:\n\nTo install RStudio, do one of the following:\n\nManual installation\nGuided installation\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbered lists\n\nUse ending punctuation.\nUse when a procedure needs to be specifically referenced.\nUse to describe things that need to be done in a sequential order\n\nPlease see Procedures/steps for more information.\n\n\n\nCalls to code\nCalls to R, Python code, shell commands, & other languages.\nDenote calls with the accent grave (example: runApp). Use the accent marks/backticks wherever appropriate. Ensure that the text within already written accent marks exactly matches the code, since it may change how code is run and result in errors.\nIf the documentation framework doesn’t support accent graves, use code blocks, inline code, or whatever the framework supports.\n\n\nGerunds & Tech jargon\nAvoid.\n\n\nNumbers\nAs a general rule, spell out single-digit numbers, and use numerals to represent double-digit numbers, e.g., one and. 10.\n\n\nAcronyms\n\nSpell out the first occurrence of an acronym per topic/page/file, followed by the acronym in parentheses.\nYou do not need to define common acronyms, such as IP.\n\nExample: - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States. The CIA has no law enforcement function."
