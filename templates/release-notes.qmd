### Breaking

- List "breaking" items (changes that result in a breakage in configuration with the new/suggested change listed) in a bullet list, if applicable.
- Example: Removes the top-level `rspm import` command, use `rspm import ssh-key` or `rspm import https-credential` instead. (#8399)

### Deprecated/Removed

- List "breaking" items in a bullet list, if applicable.
- Example: Server.RVersion is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release. Use R.Executable instead and reference the full R binary path rather than the path to a directory containing an R installation. (#21473)

    Earlier releases specify an R installation using Server.RVersion to target a directory:

    ; /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg
    [Server]
    RVersion = /opt/R/3.6.3
